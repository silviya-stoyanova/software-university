                    Tim laid out his vision for what would become the web in a
                    document called "Information Management: A Proposal".
                    Believe it or not, Tim's initial proposal was not immediately accepted.
                    In fact, his boss at the time, Mike Sendall, noted the
                    words "Vague but exciting" on the cover.

                    Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain
                    the foundation of today's web (and which you may have seen
                    appear on parts of your web browser):

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTML:</strong> HyperText Markup Language. The markup
                        (formatting) language for the web.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>URI:</strong> Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of "address" that
                        is unique and used to identify to each resource on the web. It is
                        also commonly called a URL.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>HTTP:</strong> Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the
                        retrieval of linked resources from across the web.

                    Technology to found the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an
                    international community devoted to developing open web
